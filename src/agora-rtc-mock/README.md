# Description

This module is a mock implementation of the agora-rtc-sdk methods and also implements a sub stream class
that is returned in the client events. The module is a work-in-progress and only implements the needed functionalities.

In addition it hosts mock data that is based on returns from the [stream api](https://api.akkadu.com/reference/#/Streams)
that can be, and is currently, used for tests in other modules.

- stream-data-audience (for audience members)
